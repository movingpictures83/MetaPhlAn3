PluMA plugin that will take shotgun sequence data and produces an abundance profile using MetaPhlAn3 (Beghini et al, 2021).

The plugin expects as input a TXT file with the first line devoted to the databsae, and every line afterwards the prefix to a forward and reverse FASTQ file).

The output abundance profile will be stored in the provided output directory.

Note shotgun sequence data is large, so we did not include any via github.  You also will need to install a compatible database (our parameters file assumes CHOCOPHLAN, and our local space - which you will need to change).
